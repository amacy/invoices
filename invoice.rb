## TO DO LIST
#  - Input hours at CL
#  - Input rate at CL
#  - Allow commit messages to be multiple lines
#  - Raise errors where noted (in comments)
#  - Totals

#  - Allow multiple git repos per invoice
#  - Don't print street2 when it has nc
#  - Provide control over which commits get added to the invoice
#  - Invoice.generate_number
#  - Create CLI object?
#  - Improved CLI (move cursor left; quit button; enter commands)
#  - Turn into rubygem
#  - Store invoices to database?
#  - Fix Commit.index
