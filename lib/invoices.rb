## TO DO LIST
#  - Input hours at CL
#  - Input rate at CL
#  - Allow commit messages to be multiple lines
#  - Raise errors where noted (in comments)
#  - Totals
#  - Allow queries for multiple billers/clients
#  - Allow multiple git repos per invoice
#  - Don't print street2 when it has nc
#  - Provide control over which commits get added to the invoice
#  - Create CLI object?
#  - Improved CLI (move cursor left; quit button; enter commands)
#  - Turn into rubygem
#  - Store invoices to database?
#  - Write tests
#  - Improve CLI (rather than running a file in Ruby, enter commands by typing "invoices")
#  - Allow users to select where they want their invoices to be stored
#  - Implement MVC code organization
